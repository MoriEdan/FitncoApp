## üîß Post-Upgrade Tasks

After each upgrade, run:

### iOS
```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

### Android
```bash
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
```

### Test Build
```bash
yarn start --reset-cache
yarn android  # or yarn ios
```

## üì± Platform-Specific Considerations

### iOS
- Update Podfile if necessary
- Check for iOS-specific breaking changes
- Test on iOS simulator/device

### Android
- Update android/app/build.gradle if necessary
- Check for Android-specific breaking changes
- Test on Android emulator/device

### Windows
- Ensure react-native-windows compatibility
- Test on Windows platform

## üö® Emergency Patches (If Upgrades Fail)

If any library upgrade causes critical issues, use patch-package:

1. Install patch-package:
```bash
yarn add -D patch-package
```

2. Add to package.json scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "patch-package"
  }
}
```

3. Create patches for problematic libraries:
```bash
npx patch-package library-name
```

After each upgrade, verify:

- [ ] App builds successfully
- [ ] No TypeScript/ESLint errors
- [ ] All screens load correctly
- [ ] Navigation works properly
- [ ] Firebase authentication works
- [ ] Push notifications work
